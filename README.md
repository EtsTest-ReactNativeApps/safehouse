Project created for the hackathon [Hack the Crisis](https://www.hackcrisis.com/). Let's save the world together üöÄ

## Run the project
### Run locally on your computer
You'll need Node 10 LTS or greater installed. Install Expo CLI:
```
$ npm install -g expo-cli
```
Then in your console:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/graffme/safehouse
$ cd safehouse
$ npm start
```
Check official React Native [documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) in case of problems and to see how to run it on a device or a simulator.
### Run on your device (iOS or Android)
1. Download Expo app on your device ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US)).
2. [Scan the code](https://expo.io/@graffme/safehouse) with Expo app to run **safehouse**.
3. Enjoy the prototype üì±

## Safe place for quarantine 
![Iconography 1](./assets/repo/comback.png) <br /><br />
In the daily report of the [Ministry of Health on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MZ_GOV_PL/), a huge number of people returning to the country are reported to quarantine every day. Many people may not be able to spend it at home or want to avoid it because of potential infection of the family. Also, people who are currently in the country may have the same problem. For example - the doctor finds out that he/she has had contact with a sick person and does not want to spend his/her quarantine in the family home.

Hotels and apartments for rent are currently the most affected sector. It is worth convincing the owners to make their property available as safe quarantine facilities. In this way, two problems are solved:
* Overcrowding of public quarantine facilities.
* Big economic losses in the hotel and tourism sector.

This is a quick prototype of an application with a list of apartments. Additional amenities could include grocery shopping with non-contact delivery or a **special bus/car for pick up and transport to the apartment**. 

## Adding apartments to the list
Project is very simple and quick to implement as an application, but it would require:
* Cooperation of platforms like airbnb, booking.com and others.
* A group of people who will verify applications of suites (form private hosts).
* A list of requirements that would have to be met by such places and appropriate regulations on how to clean the apartments as guests leave them.

Larger platforms can be encouraged to add in their API whether the host agrees to provide the apartment for this purpose. The list in the safehouse application could then retrieve and display this information. For example, available APIs for larger platforms:
- [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.pl/partner)
- [Booking.com](https://developers.booking.com/api/index.html)

For private hosts, an additional verification process will be needed:
1. The host reports a place via the form in the safehouse application. IMPORTANT. In the form, he must provide the website through which the place is booked and which contains contact to the owner! This contact will be used for verification.
2. An apartment is added to the database. However, it is not verified, so it will not appear on the list in the application yet.
3. A special group of people checks the apartment applications manually. They send the verification link for the host to the provided contact.
4. The host automatically clicking on the link causes the apartment to be verified and the suite appears on the list.

## Motivation
Idea heavily based on my experience during coronavirus outbreak. I got stuck ‚ùåüõ´in Los Angeles 5877 miles away from home and found out that due to the epidemic I can't continue working on a project that gave me a lot of joy and where I met a lot of amazing people üíîüíîüíîI am quite convinced that once I get back home quarantine will still be required. I would like to avoid contact with my family and friends so that they don't get infected. This is my way home üè†
