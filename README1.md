Project ceated for hackathon [Hack the Crisis](https://www.hackcrisis.com/)

## Problem
Hotels and apartments for rent are currently the most affected sector. Also, there may be a lot of people returning from abroad or people who need to be quarantined at home, but do not want to spend it there, because they are afraid to infect their family. It would be worth encouraging in this situation hotels and apartment owners to make them available for quarantine. They would have to follow proper cleaning procedures for such places after guests leave.

This is a quick prototype ofan application with a list of apartments and hotels that are open to this solution. Apartments from airbnb, booking.com and other platforms could be added to this list to signal that they are intended for these purposes so people in need can easily find them. Additional amenities could include grocery shopping with non-contact delivery or a special bus/car for pick up and transport to the apartment.

Project is very simple and quick to implement as an application, but it would require a group of people who will verify applications (only for private hosts), cooperation of platforms to add to their API information about whether the apartment is for quarantine and creation of provisions that the hosts could follow during cleaning and receiving guests.
